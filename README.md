CL auto scraper

This is a tool used to pull together a list of all auto listing by owner in the East Bay region of the SF bay area. It can be easily adapted to the desired location. Ultimately the purpose of this project is to keep tabs on raising used car prices neither due to inflation or covid.

Motivation

I am a huge auto enthusiasm and always in the market to look at desirable cars. This tool will allow us to compare historical data to see which make and year is worth buying.
